# ðŸ’¡ Project Idea: OfficeSpaceManager

OfficeSpaceManager is a modular, production-grade PowerShell CLI toolkit designed to simplify and centralise the management of Microsoft Places, Exchange Room Resources, and associated metadata across Microsoft 365 environments. The project aims to provide a single, logical workflow for administrators to set up, maintain, and recover their environment, reducing the need to navigate multiple admin portals or scripts.

## Vision & Rationale
- **Centralised Management:** Eliminate fragmented admin experiences by providing a unified CLI for all resource and metadata operations.
- **Automation & Consistency:** Enable bulk operations (import/export), enforce naming conventions, and automate repetitive tasks to reduce errors and manual effort.
- **Disaster Recovery:** Provide robust backup and restore capabilities for both configuration and metadata, ensuring business continuity.
- **Extensibility:** Use a modular structure to allow easy addition of new features, domains, and integrations as Microsoft 365 evolves.
- **User Experience:** Make the job of a Microsoft Modern Workplace analyst/engineer easier, faster, and less error-prone.

## Why This Project?
- Manual management of Microsoft Places, Exchange resources, and metadata is time-consuming and error-prone.
- Existing tools are fragmented, lack bulk/batch features, and often require deep technical knowledge.
- There is a need for a repeatable, auditable, and recoverable workflow for resource management in Microsoft 365 environments.

## Intended Audience
- Microsoft 365 administrators, Modern Workplace engineers, and IT professionals responsible for resource and metadata management.
